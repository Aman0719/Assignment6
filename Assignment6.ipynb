    "\n",
    "A class typically consists of data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) that operate on the data members. \n",

    "# Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: \n",
    "This refers to the practice of grouping related data and behavior (methods) into a single unit called a class. \n",
    "Encapsulation hides the implementation details of the class from other parts of the program, and provides a clean interface for interacting with the class. \n",
    "This helps to achieve data abstraction, information hiding, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: \n",
    "This is the mechanism by which one class (the subclass or derived class) inherits the properties (attributes and methods) of another class (the superclass or base class). \n",
    "Inheritance allows for code reuse, reduces code duplication, and facilitates the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism:\n",
    "This refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or behaviors depending on the context in which it is used. \n",
    "Polymorphism allows for more flexible and extensible code by enabling the same interface to be used with different types of objects. \n",
    "Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading, method overriding, or operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: \n",
    "This refers to the practice of representing complex real-world entities as simplified models in software. \n",
    "Abstraction focuses on the essential features of an entity and ignores the non-essential details. \n",
    "Abstraction enables programmers to create reusable software components that can be used in different contexts without modification. \n",
    "Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces."

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a new class is created from an existing class, inheriting all the properties and methods of the parent class. \n",
    "The new class is called the subclass or derived class, and the existing class is called the superclass or base class. \n",
    "The purpose of inheritance is to promote code reuse and make it easier to create new classes with similar functionality to existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance: \n",
    "In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from a single superclass. \n",
    "For example, a class \"Car\" can be a superclass, and a class \"Sedan\" can be a subclass that inherits from \"Car\". \n",
    "The Sedan class would inherit all the properties and methods of the Car class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multilevel Inheritance: \n",
    "In multilevel inheritance, a subclass inherits from a superclass, which itself is a subclass of another superclass. \n",
    "For example, a class \"Vehicle\" can be a superclass, a class \"Car\" can be a subclass that inherits from \"Vehicle\", and a class \"Sedan\" can be a subclass that inherits from \"Car\". \n",
    "The Sedan class would inherit all the properties and methods of both the Car and Vehicle classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hierarchical Inheritance: \n",
    "In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass. \n",
    "For example, a class \"Animal\" can be a superclass, and classes \"Cat\" and \"Dog\" can be subclasses that both inherit from \"Animal\". \n",
    "Both the Cat and Dog classes would inherit all the properties and methods of the Animal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multiple Inheritance: \n",
    "In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. \n",
    "For example, a class \"Athlete\" can be a superclass, and classes \"Runner\" and \"Swimmer\" can be subclasses that both inherit from \"Athlete\". \n",
    "The subclass \"Triathlete\" could then inherit from both the \"Runner\" and \"Swimmer\" classes, effectively inheriting properties and methods from multiple classes."
